This changes exactly 4 blocks:

 

TNT has the label removed

 

Un-dyed glass is clear with no streaks and a solid border

 

Pumpkins have the face removed (un-lit)

 

Glowstone is revamped to be more symmetric with the same vanilla feel.

 

Also the 'pumpkin blur' effect when wearing a head pumpkin is gone, so you can see clearly.
