Notes: 
Before melons were added to the game, back in Oct 26, 2010, someone named Tsutarja on the minecraft forum had an idea to add watermelons, with their own textures. I simply took that texture for the melon block and made a texture pack with it (in other words, I did not make this texture). The original thread is archived/locked, I really love that original green texture, and I could not find a resource pack that used it.
